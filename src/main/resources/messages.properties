welcome=Welcome to the Thymesheet Sample Homepage.
intro=When you develop HTML, it is good practice to place styling information outside of the HTML itself. This is done by adding a CSS "cascading style sheet", which tells the web browser how to style the HTML document. <br/><br/> \
Thymesheet applies the same idea to Thymeleaf. Add a link to an external Thymesheet file (or files), then remove the Thymesheet syntax from the HTML.
